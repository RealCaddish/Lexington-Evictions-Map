 ## Chapter 1: Introduction
 It has become even more apparent in recent years that  eviction rates negatively impact a community's fiscal ability to circulate its own local capital. Furthermore, the eviction rate can be a difficult process to measure due to the myriad reasons behind a renter or homeowner's otherwise involuntary reason to vacate their home. <a href="https://lexingtonfairhousing.com/resources/reports/">The Lexington Fair Housing Council's Instability Report</a> provides excellent information regarding the contemporary nature of poverty and eviction in Lexington Kentucky's communities. 

 This project seeks to track Lexington's eviction footprint from pre-pandemic rates to the present. The project is a user interface designed to grant the user data visuals concerning the rate of evictions in various neighborhoods throughout Fayette County. Furthermore, the goal of the UI is to better understand the role, dynamics, and impact of eviction throughout Lexington's segregated neighborhoods. 
 
 To be more precise, the project aims to understand how the pandemic has affected neighborhoods in terms of categorized poverty profiles. Below are brief descriptions of these categories of neighborhood that are based on racial/socio-economic profiles:
 
<b> RECAPs</b>
 
  <ul>
  <li>racially/ethnically concentrated areas of poverty where the majority of residents are non-white
  <li> the poverty rate exceeds 40% of the citywide median </li>
  </ul>

  <b>RECArPs</b>

<ul>
  <li>racially/ethnically concentrated areas of <i>relative</i> poverty where the rate is between 20 - 40%
  <li> or the median household income is 50-80% of the citywide median (RECArPs) </li>
  </ul>
  
  <b>RECAAs</b>
  
<ul>
<li> racially/ethnically concentrated areas of affluence where poor and non-white residents have traditionally been excluded from (i.e. where non-hispanic, white population exceeds the citywide average)
<li>and also where the median household income is <i>greater than </i> twice the citywide median            
</ul>

<b>RECArAs</b>
<ul>
<li> areas of the city where a common racial threshold is shared
<li> areas of the city where median household incomes are between 150 - 200% of the citywide media
<li>poverty rate is less than 5%
<li>helps in identifying areas where a minimal absence of poverty is located. 


</ul>

Understanding Lexington's eviction rate can help scholars, policymakers, and local communities understand how it effects more than just the family moving out. The removal of families from Lexington households reduces the amount of dollars circulating in the local economy and negatively impacts trust, community engagement, and resources to help mitigate this issue at large. 


## Chapter 2: Data Collection
Collection of eviction data for this project can be sparse, deliberate challenging to collect, and will require the input from state and local authorities. I've currently made plans to meet with the Lexington Fair Housing Council, contacted Lexington's Property Valuation Assessment office, and have started the general process of collecting this data.  
More particularly, the data used in this project will include polygons of RECAPs, RECArPs, RECAAS, and RECArAs. These polygons will denote what Taylor Shelton has found in his research on poverty in Lexington.
